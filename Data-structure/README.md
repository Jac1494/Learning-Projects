--------------
- Data sturcture is nothing but arrangement of data or managing the data effectively.

Data structure devide into two type
-----------------------------------

1) Linear datastructure
-> Single Link-List
-> Double Link-List

Important point for Link-List:-
-----------------------------
1) Self referential structure declaration.
2) Maintain the head pointer
3) Should we position to decide the call by value or call by reference with respect to structure pointer.
