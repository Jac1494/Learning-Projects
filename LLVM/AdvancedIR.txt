Why LLVM IR is importanat ... ?
- We can able to write target indepenent optinization.
- It is SSA for so each variable is assigned only once and every new assignent to a variable is a new variable itself. One very visible benifit of this represenataion is that we don't have to do reaching defination analysis , where some variable is assigned a value of another variable.
- SSA represenataion also helps in no of optimization Like const propogation , dead code elimination and others.

1. getelementptr
- This instruction is used to get address of the element in an aggregate data structure. It only calaculte the address and does not access the menory

2. Insering a scalar into a vector
- insertelement

3. Extracting a scalar into a vector
