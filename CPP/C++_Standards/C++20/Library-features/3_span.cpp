std::span:-

- Provides a lightweight view over a contiguous sequence of objects. 
  A span provides a safe way to iterate over and index into objects 
  that are arranged back-to-back in memory. Such as objects stored in a built-in array, std::array, or std::vector.

- If you typically access a sequence of back-to-back objects using 
  a pointer and an index, a span is a safer, lightweight alternative.

- The size of a span can be set at compile time by specifying it as a 
  template argument, or at runtime by specifying dynamic_extent.

- A span is a view (i.e. non-owning) of a container providing bounds-checked 
 access to a contiguous group of elements. Since views do not own their elements 
 they are cheap to construct and copy -- a simplified way to think about views 
 is they are holding references to their data. As opposed to maintaining 
 a pointer/iterator and length field, a span wraps both of those up in a single object.

- Spans can be dynamically-sized or fixed-sized (known as their extent). 
  Fixed-sized spans benefit from bounds-checking.

- Span doesn't propogate const so to construct a read-only span use std::span<const T>.

- As a side note, donâ€™t confuse C++17 std::string_view with the std::span introduced 
  by C++20. While both are non-owning views, std::string_view is a read-only view.
  You can, obviously, create a modifiable span or subspan from a std::string or from
  a char pointer and a buffer size pair.
