The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
=======================================
- The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. 
- It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized.

STL has 4 components
--------------------
**1. Containers**
- Array like data structures that store collections.

**2. Algorithms**
- A collection of algorithm implementaions for operations, such as search and sort.

**3. Iterators**
- Pointer-like objects that allow traversal of containers.

**4. Functions or Functors**
- The STL includes classes that overload the function call operator. Instances of such classes are called function objects or functors.
