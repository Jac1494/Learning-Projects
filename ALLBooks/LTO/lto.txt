-Collect2 is program which is internally call ld.
-Common Code (executed twice for each function in the input program for
single process LTO. Once during LGEN and then during WPA + LTRANS) 
-large call graph with procedure summaries without procedure bodies (/tmp/ccdKEyVB.ltrans0.o)
-Identical Code Folding (ICF)
     Identical code folding is a new pass (contributed by Martin Li≈°ka, SUSE) looking for functions with the same code and variables with the same constructors. If some are found, one copy is removed and replaced one by an alias to another where possible. This is especially important for C++ code bases that tend to contain duplicated functions as a result of template instantiations
